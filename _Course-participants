Hi, I'm Pallavi Reddy Gaddam .  I graduate student in Compputer Science from Northern Arizona University.  
Over the past 3 years I've worked as an open-source software engineer in the Value Momentum, and now I'm the coding and lab support for your course.  
I really look forward to working with all of you!
