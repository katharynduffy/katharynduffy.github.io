Hi, I'm Dr. Katharyn Duffy.  I have a Ph.D in Earth Science from Northern Arizona University. 
Over the past three years I've worked as an open-source software test engineer in Value Momentum, and now I'm the coding and lab support for your course. 
I really look forward to working with all of you.
